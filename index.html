      <p>Do you have a dusty classic in your garage, barn, or field?</p>

      <p>A long term project you just never seem to get to?</p>

      <p>We want to buy it.</p>

      <p>We buy classics in any condition. While we focus on American classics, we also buy English, German, Italian, Swedish, Japanese, and [maybe even] French brands. Send us some pictures! We want your Dusty Old Car!</p>

      <p>If you have a car you would like to sell, please send us somes pictures and a brief description to info@dustyclassics.ca. We'll get back to you within 24 hours. When sending photos, please remember that we want to see the good, the bad and the ugly! Specifically, we like to see shots of all four sides, the seats, the headliner, the dash, the odometer, the engine bay, the VIN, and any trouble spots on the body. We will be in touch promptly.</p>

      <p>Thank you!</p>

      <p>The Dusty Classics Team</p>
